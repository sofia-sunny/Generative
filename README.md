# Generative
A collection of tutorials and reproducible workflows for applying generative models in computational drug discovery. This repository covers key tasks including de novo molecular design, lead optimization, and similarity-based analog generation. Emphasis is placed on goal-directed molecule generation guided by structural constraints, property profiles, and target relevance
